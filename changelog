-Edited make_release.sh and make_branch.sh script to create a meta file with information regarding the release and create checksum files, signing all with GPG.
-Added more hash functions to release files...(SHA512, Whirlpool, SHA3-512, and TIGER)

-Added Whirlpool because it was developed in part by Vincent Rijmen.
