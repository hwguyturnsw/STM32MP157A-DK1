-Trying to figure out expanding filesystem to take up entire SD card (Issue #1.)

05.21.2022
-Edited make_release.sh and make_branch.sh script to create a meta file with information regarding the release and create checksum files, signing all with GPG.
-Added more hash functions to release files...(SHA512, Whirlpool, SHA3-512, and TIGER)
-Added SHA512 and SHA3-512. SHA was developed by the NSA and that's fine, most people accept SHA checksums but I am adding others as well.
-Added Whirlpool because it was developed in part by Vincent Rijmen.
-Added TIGER-192,3 hash as well since that was developed in part by Ross Anderson and I respect him as a security reasearcher and developer.
